# OmniCellTOSG: The First Cell Text-Omic Signaling Graphs Dataset for Joint LLM and GNN Modeling

![Figure1](./Figures/Figure1.png)

The human body consists of approximately 37 trillion cells, all originating from a single embryonic cell and sharing the same copy of genome. The complex, robust and accurate cell signaling systems, regulated by varying abundance of proteins and their interactions, create diverse cell types with different functions at different organs. The cell signaling systems are evolved and altered by many factors, like age, sex, diet, environment exposures and diseases. However, it remains an open problem to decode cell signaling systems or patterns in normal development or diseases because the systems are rather complex consists of tens of thousands of genes/proteins and massive interactions among them. Recently, hundreds of millions of single cell omic data have been being generated by many research projects, which provide the solid basis for understanding cell signaling systems, like the key genes/proteins and their signaling interactions, within diverse cell-subpopulations in different conditions. Moreover, inspired by the success of foundation models that are pre-trained on massive datasets, like large language models (LLMs) and large vision models (LVMs), in this study, we build the first dataset of cell text-omic signaling graphs (TOSGs), named OmniCellTOSG. Each TOSG represents the signaling graph/system of an individual cell or meta-cell, and associated with labels, like organ, disease, sex, age, cell-subtype. The unique contributions of the OmniCellTOSG are two-folds. First, the TOSGs represents a novel and ideal graph data model for decoding cell signaling systems via graph reasoning by incorporating human-understandable textual annotation/prior knowledge (like biological functions, cellular locations, related signaling pathways, related diseases and drugs), with numeric values (that represent the observed abundance levels genes/proteins) in different cells in different organs and conditions. Also new paradigm-shift data analysis models like the joint LLM and GNN models are needed to analyze the TOSGs. Secondly, OmniCellTOSG consists of large-scale cell text-omic signaling graphs, using single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) data from ~120 millions cells from diverse tissues/organs, health vs diseases. The OmniCellTOSG data are structured in a format that is fully compatible with PyTorch, and can facilitate the development of novel joint LLM and graph neural network (GNN) foundation cell signaling models for decoding the complex cell signaling systems via TOSG graph reasoning. It could shift the paradigm in life sciences, healthcare and precision medicine research.

### 1.4 Seattle Alzheimer's Disease Brain Cell Atlas (SEA-AD)
#### Data Introduction
SEA-AD data is accessible through their API using the Synapse client. Authentication is handled via personal access tokens, and data is retrieved through synIDs based on different folders.

#### Download Instructions
Install the required Python packages:
```
pip install synapseclient synapseutils
```
Download data using the following Python script:
```
import synapseclient
import synapseutils

# Set up authentication
syn = synapseclient.Synapse()
token = "YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"  # Replace with your token
syn.login(authToken=token)

# Define folder IDs
folder_ids = [
    "syn26273710", "syn51792375", "syn52314491", 
    "syn52314469", "syn61680896", "syn52314488", "syn52314472"
]

# Download all datasets
for folder_id in folder_ids:
    synapseutils.syncFromSynapse(syn, folder_id)
```

## 2. Preprocessing Data

### 2.1 Data Format Conversion
This section describes the standardized preprocessing pipeline to convert all datasets into a unified H5AD or H5 format.

GEO Data Processing:
```python
python Process/GEO_process.py
```

All the other datasets are already in H5AD or H5 format.

### 2.2 Cell Type Annotation
We use CellTypist for automated cell type annotation:
#### GEO datasets 
For GEO datasets with diverse tissue and disease types, we developed a mapping strategy to match each dataset with the most appropriate CellTypist model. The complete mapping table is available in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FuhaiLiAiLab/OmniCellTOSG/tree/main/Data) 
```python
python Process/addCellType_GEO.py
```
#### SEA-AD datasets 
For SEA-AD datasets focusing on Alzheimer's disease, we directly use the 'Adult_Human_PrefrontalCortex.pkl' model.
```python
python Process/addCellType_SEA-AD.py
```
### 2.3 Cell Type Clustering
```python
python Process/cell_type_clustering.py
```
### 2.4 Organ Clustering
Finer-grained anatomical substructures were manually merged into broader organ categories based on anatomical structures. For example, the **brain** organ includes the following substructures:
| Organ  | Substructures |
|--------|---------------|
| **Brain** | Cerebral cortex, Cerebellum, Forebrain, Basal ganglion, Caudal ganglionic eminence, Ganglionic eminence, Parietal lobe, Frontal lobe, Temporal lobe, Occipital lobe, Right frontal lobe, Left frontal lobe, Right parietal lobe, Left parietal lobe, Right temporal lobe, Left temporal lobe, Right occipital lobe |

### 2.5 Disease Clustering
Related disease subtypes were grouped into broader disease categories based on clinical and pathological characteristics. For example, the **multiple sclerosis** category includes the following subtypes:
| Disease                | Subtypes |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Multiple Sclerosis** | Multiple sclerosis, Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, Clinically isolated syndrome |

## 3. Meta-cell Generation
